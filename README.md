# MEAN_Stack_Front


I created this repository as part of a project that I created in order to learn nodeJS.
Server- nodeJS
DB- mongoDB
Client- I used HBS template && javascript 


When a user clicks on the Register, there is a register form. The user should insert the following fields:
1.Name
2.Username
3.Email
4.Password


When the user press on the sign up button, there is a check on the server side whether the user exists in the database.
If the user doesn't exist, we save him in the DB.

I used the passport module to encode the user's password.
